# Surfs-up
## Overview
- The main purpose of this analysis was to extract and study the temparature trend in Hawaii for the month of june and december.

## Results
- The outcome of the analysis done for the month of june and december is shown below. This data is achieved by using describe function to show the statistic for that particular month.
- Data for June month is shown below:

### Key differences
- The temparature at the month of June on average is around 75 F. The maximum and minimum temparature recorded was 64F and 85F respectively.
- The average temparature recoreded at the month of December is around 71.04. Lowest temprature recorded was 56F where was highest was 83F.
- From the above comparison it is clear that, the temparature during middle of the years is higher than at the end of the year.

### Summary
- To summerize, the temparature in december was 4 degree warmer than July. To decide on surfs, I would recommend july to be the suitable climate to do so. Because the trend during december changes and most people dont prefer to surf at the end of the year.
#### To achieve more detailed result on the provided data, the below mentioned queries would have helped.
- We could have used station column or station table itself to compare the temparature. Some of the information available in station table like longitude and latitude can be used to do a detailed analysis. The behaviour of the climate change can be understood better helping us to study the changes happening in human behaviour with respect to climate. 
- Just considering the temparature as the single factor to do the analysis wont do the justification. If we have other data which affects the surfing bussiness should also be considered to make strong analysis.
